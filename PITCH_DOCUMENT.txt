================================================================================
                    SCHOOL FEE MANAGEMENT PLATFORM
                         PITCH DOCUMENT
================================================================================

Dear Principal,

You already know the headache: chasing fee balances, counting cash,
printing receipts, tracking defaulters, fielding "how much do I owe?"
calls from parents. This platform replaces all of that with one system
that works for you, your bursar, and your parents — 24/7.

Below is everything you need to know.


================================================================================
  1. THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE
================================================================================

Every term, Kenyan schools deal with the same issues:

  ❌  Manual fee collection — cash in envelopes, handwritten receipts,
     exercise books used as ledgers. Money gets lost, miscounted, or
     unaccounted for.

  ❌  No real-time visibility — "How much have we collected this term?"
     requires the bursar to manually add up figures, sometimes taking days.

  ❌  Chasing defaulters — the school has no easy way to know who owes
     what. Staff spend hours calling parents or sending letters.

  ❌  Parents in the dark — parents don't know their exact balance,
     what fees apply, or whether their last payment was recorded.

  ❌  No audit trail — if a payment is disputed, there's no reliable
     record. If a receipt is lost, it's gone.

  ❌  Reporting is painful — end-of-term reports, board reports, and
     government submissions require manually compiling data from
     multiple sources.

  ❌  Cash handling risk — large amounts of cash moving through the
     school creates security and accountability concerns.


================================================================================
  2. WHAT THE PLATFORM DOES
================================================================================

One system that handles fee collection from start to finish:

  ✅  SET UP your school once — classes, streams, fee structures, terms
  ✅  GENERATE invoices for every student in one click
  ✅  COLLECT payments via M-Pesa (straight to school account)
  ✅  TRACK every shilling in real time
  ✅  REPORT on collections, defaulters, and aging debt instantly
  ✅  GIVE PARENTS their own portal to check balances and pay


================================================================================
  3. FEATURE BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  3.1  FEE SETUP & CLASS MANAGEMENT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  •  Create classes with grades and streams (e.g. Form 1 East, Form 1 West)
  •  Define fee structures per class:
     - Tuition, Boarding, Transport, Meals, Uniform, Exam Fees,
       Activities/Clubs, and custom categories
  •  Set amounts per fee item — different classes can have different fees
  •  Manage academic terms/periods — activate the current term,
     archive past ones
  •  Apply fee changes across all streams of a grade in one action

  → WHAT THIS REPLACES: Spreadsheets, handwritten fee schedules,
    and the confusion that comes with inconsistent fee structures
    across streams.


─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  3.2  STUDENT & PARENT MANAGEMENT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  •  Register students with admission numbers, class assignments,
     and parent linkage
  •  Register parents/guardians with email and phone number
  •  Each parent gets their own login to the platform
  •  Link multiple children to one parent account
  •  Search, filter, and manage records easily
  •  Activate/deactivate students (e.g. when a student transfers)

  → WHAT THIS REPLACES: Paper admission files, phone lists in
    exercise books, and no reliable way to contact all parents.


─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  3.3  INVOICE GENERATION (Billing Runs)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  •  Generate invoices for ALL active students in one click
  •  Each invoice automatically pulls the correct fee structure
     for the student's class

  •  Track invoice status: Unpaid → Partially Paid → Paid
  •  Print individual invoices as professional PDFs
  •  Export all invoices to CSV for your records
  •  Parents can dismiss optional fee items (e.g. transport if they
     don't use school transport)

  → WHAT THIS REPLACES: Manually writing fee sheets for each student,
    calculating balances by hand, and printing generic fee lists that
    don't show individual balances.


─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  3.4  M-PESA PAYMENTS (Mobile Money)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  •  Parents pay directly from the app via M-Pesa STK Push

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  •  Parents can set up a payment plan if they can't pay in full
  •  Choose instalment frequency: Weekly, Bi-weekly, or Monthly
  •  Set their own instalment amount and start date
  •  The system tracks their progress and compliance
  •  Principal can see which parents are on plans and whether
     they're keeping up

  → WHAT THIS REPLACES: Verbal promises from parents ("I'll pay
    next week"), handshake agreements with no tracking, and
    the school having no visibility into who intends to pay when.


─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  3.6  REPORTS & ANALYTICS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  •  COLLECTION RATE — see what percentage of billed fees have
     been collected, with a progress bar and target tracking

  •  AGING REPORT — outstanding debt broken down by age:
     0–30 days, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, 90+ days
     (shows you which debts are becoming problematic)

  •  REVENUE FORECAST — predicted collections for the next
     30 and 60 days based on pending invoices

     collected on any given day, broken down by payment method

  •  CSV EXPORTS — download any report as a spreadsheet for
     further analysis or government submissions

  → WHAT THIS REPLACES: The bursar spending days compiling
    end-of-term reports, guessing at collection rates, and
    presenting incomplete data to the board.


─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  3.7  APPROVAL WORKFLOW (Dual Authorization)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  •  Invoice cancellations and adjustments require approval
     from a second administrator

  •  Full audit trail: who requested, who approved, when, and why
  •  Pending approvals surfaced on the dashboard so nothing
     gets missed

  → WHAT THIS REPLACES: One person having unchecked control
    over financial records, with no accountability mechanism.

     invoices, and receipts
  •  Set your school tagline
  •  Choose your brand colour
  •  Professional appearance on all printed documents

  → Makes the platform feel like YOUR school's system,
    not a generic third-party tool.


================================================================================
  4. WHAT WE AIM TO REDUCE
================================================================================

  📉  TIME SPENT ON FEE ADMINISTRATION
     Currently: Bursar spends 2–3 hours daily on manual
     reconciliation, receipt writing, and parent follow-ups.
     Target: Reduce to under 15 minutes per day.

  📉  CASH HANDLING
     Currently: Large volumes of cash pass through the office
     with limited accountability.
     Target: Shift 80%+ of payments to M-Pesa — money goes
     straight to the school account, fully tracked.

  📉  DEFAULTER FOLLOW-UP TIME
     Currently: Staff manually identify and contact defaulters,
     often weeks after fees are overdue.
     Target: Instant defaulter reports. Parents proactively
     see their balances and can set up payment plans.

  📉  REPORTING TIME
     Currently: End-of-term reports take days to compile.
     Target: Real-time dashboards and one-click reports.

  📉  PARENT COMPLAINTS & DISPUTES
     Currently: "I paid but it wasn't recorded" disputes are
     common and hard to resolve without documentation.
     Target: Every payment has a digital receipt and audit trail.
     Disputes resolved in the portal, not over the phone.

  📉  REVENUE LEAKAGE
     Currently: Fees go uncollected because there's no systematic
     follow-up and parents don't know their exact balance.
     Target: Transparent balances, automated invoicing, and
     payment plans increase collection rates.


================================================================================
  5. STRONG POINTS TO EMPHASISE IN THE PITCH
================================================================================

  1.  "YOU'LL KNOW YOUR NUMBERS INSTANTLY"
      No more waiting for the bursar to compile figures.
      Open your dashboard — collection rate, outstanding fees,
      and revenue forecast are right there.

  2.  "PARENTS PAY FROM THEIR PHONE"
      M-Pesa integration means parents don't need to visit
      the school to pay. They open the app, tap "Pay", and
      the money hits your account in seconds.

  3.  "EVERY SHILLING IS TRACKED"
      Full audit trail for every payment, every invoice edit,
      every cancellation. No more "the money went missing"
      situations.

  4.  "ONE CLICK TO BILL THE WHOLE SCHOOL"
      Set up your fee structures once. At the start of term,
      click "Generate Invoices" — every student gets their
      personalised invoice automatically.

  5.  "PARENTS STOP CALLING TO ASK THEIR BALANCE"
      Parents have their own portal. They can see their
      balance, payment history, and receipts 24/7.

  6.  "DEFAULTERS LIST IN 3 SECONDS, NOT 3 DAYS"
      Click "Fee Defaulters" → instant list with names,
      amounts, and contact details. Print it for your
      board meeting.

  7.  "NO UPFRONT HARDWARE COST"
      It's a web application — works on any computer, tablet,
      or phone with a browser. No special equipment needed.

  8.  "YOUR SCHOOL, YOUR BRAND"
      Your logo, your colours, your tagline — on every
      invoice, receipt, and the parent portal.

  9.  "TWO PEOPLE TO CANCEL AN INVOICE"
      Built-in dual-authorization means one person can't
      quietly write off fees. Every adjustment needs a
      second approval.

  10. "PARENTS CAN PAY IN INSTALMENTS"
      Instead of turning away students whose parents can't
      pay in full, offer structured payment plans that the
      system tracks automatically.


================================================================================
  6. HOW TO STRUCTURE THE MEETING
================================================================================

  STEP 1: ASK THE PAIN QUESTIONS (5 minutes)
  ──────────────────────────────────────────
  Start by asking these — let THEM tell you the problem exists:

  •  "How does your bursar currently track fee payments?"
  •  "How long does it take to compile a defaulters list?"
  •  "How do parents find out their balance?"
  •  "Have you ever had a disputed payment where you couldn't
     find the receipt?"
  •  "How much cash passes through the school office on a
     given day?"

  STEP 2: LIVE DEMO (10 minutes)
  ──────────────────────────────────────────
  Show the dashboard → generate an invoice → show the parent
  portal → pull up the defaulters report → show the collection
  rate in real time. Let them see it working.

  Demo flow:
  1. Log in as Principal → show the dashboard stats
  2. Go to Classes → show fee structures
  3. Go to Invoices → show "Generate Invoices" button
  4. Open a student's invoice → print it as PDF
  5. Switch to Parent view → show balance, "Pay via M-Pesa"
  6. Go to Reports → show collection rate and defaulters list
  7. Show the approval workflow for cancellations
  8. Show the school branding (logo on receipts)

  STEP 3: ANCHOR ON OUTCOMES (5 minutes)
  ──────────────────────────────────────────
  Don't sell features — sell outcomes:

  •  "Your bursar gets 2 hours back every day"
  •  "Parents pay without visiting the school"
  •  "You'll never lose track of a payment again"
  •  "Your board gets professional reports, on demand"
  •  "Your collection rate goes up because parents
     know exactly what they owe and can pay instantly"

  STEP 4: HANDLE OBJECTIONS
  ──────────────────────────────────────────

  "Our parents aren't tech-savvy"
  → They use M-Pesa every day. If they can send money,
    they can use this. The parent portal is simple —
    log in, see balance, tap pay.

  "We don't have good internet"
  → The system works on any connection. M-Pesa works over
    USSD, not internet. The parent pays like a normal
    M-Pesa transaction.

  "We've used systems before and they were complicated"
  → This was built specifically for Kenyan schools.
    No accounting jargon, no complicated setup.
    A principal can learn it in one sitting.

  "What if M-Pesa goes down?"
  → Payments are recorded with timestamps. If there's a
    delay from Safaricom, the system reconciles
    automatically when it comes back.

  "How secure is our data?"
  → Password-protected accounts, role-based access
    (principal sees everything, parents see only their
    children), dual authorization for sensitive actions.


================================================================================
  7. PRICING TALKING POINTS
================================================================================

  When discussing pricing, emphasise value over cost:

  •  "How much does the school lose each term in uncollected
     fees? Even recovering 5% more pays for this many times over."

  •  "How many hours does your bursar spend on manual work?
     That's salary you're paying for work a system can do."

  •  "What's the cost of a disputed payment that you can't
     resolve? One prevented dispute justifies the investment."

  (Set your actual pricing based on school size and what
  the market can bear. Consider per-student-per-term or
  flat monthly fee models.)


================================================================================
  8. WHAT'S COMING NEXT (Roadmap Teasers)
================================================================================

  You can mention these as "coming soon" to show the platform
  is growing:

  •  SMS notifications — automatic reminders to parents when
     fees are due or overdue
  •  Bulk data import — upload student lists from spreadsheets
  •  Bank payment support — for parents who prefer bank transfers
  •  Multi-term analytics — year-over-year comparison of
     collection performance
  •  Student report cards — academic integration (optional)

  These show you're building a long-term platform, not a
  one-time project.


================================================================================

  BOTTOM LINE:

  This platform turns fee collection from a manual, error-prone,
  time-consuming process into something that runs itself.

  The principal gets visibility. The bursar gets time back.
  Parents get convenience. The school gets more money collected,
  faster, with a full audit trail.

================================================================================
