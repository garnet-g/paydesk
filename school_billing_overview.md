# How Paydesk Works: A Simple Guide

Welcome to the Paydesk overview! This guide is designed to explain how our school billing platform works in plain, simple terms—without the complex technical jargon.

## 1. What is Paydesk?
Paydesk is a smart platform that helps schools easily manage student fees and helps parents pay those fees without any hassle. Instead of dealing with lost paper receipts, long bank queues, or confusing spreadsheets, our app brings everything into one neat, digital space.

## 2. How the App Works (The Big Picture)
The process is straightforward:
1. **The School Sets Up:** The school registers on the platform, adds their fee structures, and securely enters their receiving bank or M-Pesa details.
2. **Invoices are Sent:** At the start of a term, the system generates fee invoices for all students.
3. **Parents Pay:** Parents are notified of the balance and pay using their phone or bank.
4. **Records are Updated:** The payment is recorded, the parent gets a digital receipt, and the school's finance dashboard updates instantly.

## 3. How We Charge (School Subscription Tiers)
Schools pay us a subscription fee for using the software. We offer different tiers based on the school's needs:
* **Basic Tier:** Offers the essentials. Schools can generate invoices and accept standard payments like manual bank transfers for free.
* **PRO Tier:** Unlocks advanced tools. This includes the ability to offer flexible "Payment Plans" (installments) to parents, and "Broadcasts" (bulk SMS and email notifications).
* **Enterprise Tier:** For very large schools or groups of schools needing custom features, dedicated support, and advanced integrations.

*(Note: Parents are never charged by us to view their child's portal; the software is a service provided to the school.)*

## 4. The Principal & Administrator Side (What the School Sees)
When a Principal or Finance Officer logs in, they get a powerful "Command Center" (Dashboard). 

**Key Features for the School:**
* **Real-Time Dashboard:** A highly visual screen showing exactly how much money has been collected, how much is still owed, and recent payment activities.
* **Student & Fee Management:** Easily view every student's individual balance and fee history.
* **Payment Approvals:** For parents who pay via manual Bank Transfer, the finance team can easily review the transfer details and click "Approve" to update the student's balance.
* **Automated Broadcasts (PRO):** Send bulk SMS or email reminders to all parents with unpaid balances with just a few clicks.
* **Role Permissions:** Super Admins can control what teachers or regular finance staff can see and do within the app.

## 5. The Parent Side (What the Parents See)
We designed the parent experience to be as stress-free as possible. Parents don't need to be tech-savvy to use it.

**How it works for Parents:**
* **Clear Balances:** Parents can easily see exactly how much they owe, what the fees are for (e.g., Tuition, Transport, Lunch), and when they are due.
* **Flexible Payment Options:** 
  * **M-Pesa:** Parents can quickly pay directly from their mobile phones.
  * **Bank Transfers:** We automatically display the school's correct bank details right on the invoice so parents can transfer money directly from their banking app.
* **Payment Plans (If enabled by school):** For schools on the PRO plan, parents can be put on agreed-upon installment plans, making large fee payments more manageable.
* **Instant Digital Receipts:** No more losing little slips of paper. Every payment generates a digital receipt that the parent can view or download anytime.

## Summary of the Daily Process
1. **Morning:** The Principal logs in and sees that 15 parents paid via M-Pesa overnight. The dashboard revenue goes up automatically.
2. **Mid-Day:** A parent makes a manual Bank Transfer and inputs the reference number. The Finance Officer sees a "Pending Approval" notification, verifies it with the bank statement, and clicks "Approve". 
3. **Afternoon:** The Principal uses the Broadcast feature to send a polite SMS reminder to parents whose fees are due next week. 

Everything stays tracked, transparent, and effortlessly organized!
